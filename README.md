# 〰️ N-ary | A granular synthesis live coding envirnoment

**N-ARY** is a web-based live coding environment for harmonic granular synthesis. It allows users to generate organic sound textures, sonic clouds, and microtonal atmospheres using a minimalist and intuitive programming language.

Inspired by boutique pedals like the *Hologram Microcosm*, this engine focuses on "controlled imperfection" and harmonic richness.

## 🔊 Getting Started

1. Download the `N-ary.html` file and open it in any web browser.
2. Type your code in the editor.
3. Press **`Ctrl + Enter`** to **render** or update the sound.
4. Press **`Ctrl + .`** to **stop** the engine.
5. ENJOY!

## 📄 Language Syntax

The language is based on **Fluxes**. A flux is defined by a name followed by the `>` symbol and a list of indented attributes.
```n-ary
cloud_name > source triangle
  rate 10
  grain 500ms

## 🎛️ Functions & Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Recommended Values |
| ---- | --- | --- |
| **source** | The base waveform of the generator. | `sine`, `triangle`, `sawtooth`, `square` |
| **rate** | How many grains are generated per second (speed). | `1` to `60` |
| **grain** | The duration of each individual sound fragment. | `10ms` to `5000ms` |
| **jitter** | Temporal chaos. Randomly offsets the start of each grain. | `0` to `0.5` |
| **pitch** | Transposition of the base note (in semitones). | `-24` to `24` |
| **fine_detune** | Fine pitch adjustment to create "chorus" or thickness. | `0` to `50` |
| **reverb** | Spatial depth and filter darkness. | `0` (dry) to `1.0` (infinite) |
| **activity** | Probability of a grain being triggered. | `0` to `1.0` |

 
## 🤓⌨️ Examples
1. Atmospheric Cloud (Ambient Pad)
  A soft, deep texture that evolves slowly.
```
atmosphere > source sine
  rate 12

  jitter 0.1
  pitch -12
  reverb 0.95
  fine_detune 15
```
2. Electric Sparks (Glitchy)
  Short, high-pitched sounds with random rhythmic cuts.
```
sparks > source triangle
  rate 4
  activity 0.3
  grain 40ms
  pitch 24
  reverb 0.2
```

3. Deep Detuned Bass
  A solid sound with organic movement.
